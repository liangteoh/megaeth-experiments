# MegaETH Overview

MegaETH aims to make Ethereum execution instant by introducing:
- **Sequencer rotation:** operators compete to produce blocks across global time zones
- **Proximity markets:** traders bid for co-location near sequencers for lower latency
- **$MEGA token:** used for staking and bidding in sequencer and colocation auctions

### Why it matters
Traditional Layer 2s like Arbitrum or Optimism optimize throughput.
MegaETH optimizes *speed and physical proximity*, turning block production into a global relay.

### My takeaway
Even as a non-developer, I can see MegaETH’s design could change how DeFi and arbitrage operate — milliseconds will matter again.
